Mid project submission for creating a data warehouse
The overall objectives of this project are to build a data warehouse from real-world datasets, and to carry out basic data mining activities including association rule mining, classification and clustering. This consisted of activites such as answering business queires and displaying them on powerbI. The used data set was US-adult Income data set from https://www.kaggle.com/johnolafenwa/us-census-data.

The tasks that were conducted for this mid project were:

Create a StarNet with the aim to identify the dimensions and concept hierarchies for each dimension.
Implement a star or snowflake schema using SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS). 
Load the data from the csv files to populate the tables.
Use SQL Server Data Tools to build a multi-dimensional analysis service solution, with a cube designed to answer your business queries.
Use Power BI to visualise the data returned from your business queries.
